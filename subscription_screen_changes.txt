Based on the Figma design, the _buildHeaderText() method in subscription_screen.dart should be updated to:

```dart
Widget _buildHeaderText() {
  return Column(
    children: [
      Text(
        "Support LinguaX & Start Your Arabic Learning Today",
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        style: TextStyle(
          fontFamily: 'Lato',
          fontWeight: FontWeight.w800,
          fontSize: 24.fSize,
          color: Color(0xFF37251F),
        ),
      ),
      SizedBox(height: 16.h),
      Text(
        "LinguaX is designed to help you master Arabic faster through immersive reading and listening.\n\nBy subscribing, you're not just unlocking the appâ€”you're supporting its growth and helping us build the best language learning experience.",
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        style: TextStyle(
          fontFamily: 'Lato',
          fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
          fontSize: 14.fSize,
          color: Color(0xFF80706B),
        ),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

The changes include:
1. Update the main heading font size to 24 (from 22)
2. Combine the two explanatory paragraphs into one text widget with a line break
3. Update the font size to 14 (from 15)
4. Text content is exactly as shown in the Figma design
