The riddles led them through dangerous passages and steep slopes, where they faced strange tests. At each stage, they had to give up something precious: inherited jewelry, wedding rings, and even happy memories. As they got closer to their goal, the dangers increased and their losses deepened. They didn't realize that the goblin was enjoying watching them struggle with greed, observing how they abandoned priceless things for empty promises. Finally, they reached a vast room ﬁlled with magical mirrors, where each saw a reﬂection of themselves burdened with greed and avarice. The goblin laughed deeply and said, "The real treasure is the wisdom you've gained. Gold perishes, but lessons remain. Look at what you've lost in your pursuit of wealth." The villagers returned to their village wiser, carrying a lesson they would never forget about the true value of things. ﻛﺗﺎب اﻟﺳﺣر Description: An adventure about friendship, courage, and the true meaning of magical power, exploring themes of loyalty and personal growth. اﻛﺗﺷف ﺛﻼﺛﺔ أﺻدﻗﺎء - ﺳﺎرة، ﻛرﯾم، وﻟﯾث - ﻛﺗﺎﺑﺎً ﻗدﯾﻣﺎً ﻣﺧﺑﺄً ﻓﻲ ﻣﻛﺗﺑﺔ ﺟدھم . اﻟﻣﻐﺑرة ﻛﺎﻧت ﺻﻔﺣﺎﺗﮫ ﻣﻐطﺎة ﺑرﻣوز ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ وﺗﻌﺎوﯾذ ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ، وﻛﺎن ﯾﺷﻊ ﻣﻧﮫ ﺿوء ﺧﺎﻓت ﻓﻲ . اﻟظﻼم ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﻓﺗﺣوه ﻣﻌﺎً، ظﮭر ﺣﺎرس اﻟﻛﺗﺎب، ﻛﺎﺋن ﻧوراﻧﻲ ﯾﺗﺄﻟق ﺑﺄﻟوان ﻗوس ﻗزح، ﺗﺗﻐﯾر أﻟواﻧﮫ ﻣﻊ ﻛل ﺣرﻛﺔ . ﻗﺎل اﻟﺣﺎرس ﺑﺻوت ﻋﻣﯾق ﯾﺗردد ﺻداه ﻓﻲ : اﻟﻣﻛﺗﺑﺔ ﻟﻘد " أﯾﻘظﺗم ﻗوى ﻋظﯾﻣﺔ ﻧﺎﺋﻣﺔ ﻣﻧذ . ﻗرون ﻻﺧﺗﺑﺎر ﺟدارﺗﻛم، ﻋﻠﯾﻛم إﻛﻣﺎل ﺛﻼث ﻣﮭﻣﺎت ﺗﺧﺗﺑر ﺷﺟﺎﻋﺗﻛم وﺣﻛﻣﺗﻛم وإﺧﻼﺻﻛم ﻟﺑﻌﺿﻛم ." اﻟﺑﻌض ﺑدأت اﻟﻣﻐﺎﻣرة ﻣﻊ اﻟﻣﮭﻣﺔ اﻷوﻟﻰ - ﻣﺳﺎﻋدة ﺷﺟرة ﻋﺟوز ﺗﺣﺗﺿر ﻛﺎﻧت ﻣﺻدر اﻟﺣﯾﺎة ﻟﻐﺎﺑﺔ . ﺑﺄﻛﻣﻠﮭﺎ اﻛﺗﺷﻔوا أن اﻟﺷﺟرة ﺗﺣﺗﺎج إﻟﻰ ﻗﺻص وذﻛرﯾﺎت ﺳﻌﯾدة ﻟﺗﺳﺗﻌﯾد ﻗوﺗﮭﺎ . ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﻣﮭﻣﺔ اﻟﺛﺎﻧﯾﺔ أﺻﻌب - إﺻﻼح ﺟﺳر ﻣﻛﺳور ﯾﻔﺻل ﺑﯾن ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺗﯾن ﻣﺗﺧﺎﺻﻣﺗﯾن ﻣﻧذ . أﺟﯾﺎل ﻟم ﯾﻛن اﻟﺟﺳر ﻣﺎدﯾﺎً ﻓﺣﺳب، ﺑل ﻛﺎن ﯾرﻣز إﻟﻰ اﻟرواﺑط اﻟﻣﻘطوﻋﺔ ﺑﯾن . اﻟﻧﺎس أﻣﺎ اﻟﻣﮭﻣﺔ اﻟﺛﺎﻟﺛﺔ واﻷﺧطر، ﻓﻛﺎﻧت ﻣواﺟﮭﺔ ﻣﺧﺎوﻓﮭم اﻟداﺧﻠﯾﺔ اﻟﺗﻲ ﺗﺟﺳدت ﻓﻲ ﺷﻛل ظﻼل ﺣﯾﺔ ﺗطﺎردھم ﻓﻲ ﻣﺗﺎھﺔ ﻣن اﻟﻣراﯾﺎ . ﻓﻲ ﻛل ﻣﮭﻣﺔ، اﻛﺗﺷف اﻷﺻدﻗﺎء اﻟﺛﻼﺛﺔ أن اﻟﻘوة اﻟﺣﻘﯾﻘﯾﺔ ﻻ ﺗﻛﻣن ﻓﻲ اﻟﺗﻌﺎوﯾذ اﻟﺳﺣرﯾﺔ، ﺑل ﻓﻲ ﺷﺟﺎﻋﺗﮭم وﺗﻌﺎوﻧﮭم وﻋطﻔﮭم ﺗﺟﺎه ﺑﻌﺿﮭم . اﻟﺑﻌض ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ أﻛﻣﻠوا اﻟﻣﮭﻣﺎت اﻟﺛﻼث، ﻣﻧﺣﮭم اﻟﺣﺎرس ھدﯾﺔ أﺛﻣن ﻣن اﻟﺳﺣر ﻧﻔﺳﮫ - اﻟﺣﻛﻣﺔ ﻻﺳﺗﺧدام ﻗواھم ﻣن أﺟل اﻟﺧﯾر، وﻓﮭم أن أﻋظم ﺳﺣر ھو ذﻟك اﻟذي ﯾﺟﻣﻊ اﻟﻘﻠوب وﯾﺑﻧﻲ اﻟﺟﺳور ﺑﯾن اﻟﻧﺎس . The Spellbook Three friends - Sarah, Kareem, and Laith - discovered an ancient book hidden in their grandfather's dusty library. Its pages were covered with strange symbols and ancient spells, emanating a faint glow in the darkness. When they opened it together, the book's guardian appeared, a luminous being shimmering with rainbow colors that changed with every movement. 


--- Page 4 ---

The guardian spoke in a deep voice that echoed through the library: "You have awakened great powers that have slept for centuries. To test your worthiness, you must complete three tasks that will test your courage, wisdom, and loyalty to each other." The adventure began with the ﬁrst task - helping a dying old tree that was the source of life for an entire forest. They discovered that the tree needed stories and happy memories to regain its strength. The second task was more challenging - repairing a broken bridge separating two families who had been feuding for generations. The bridge wasn't just physical; it symbolized the broken bonds between people. The third and most dangerous task was confronting their inner fears, which manifested as living shadows chasing them through a maze of mirrors. In each task, the three friends discovered that true power lies not in magical spells, but in their courage, cooperation, and compassion for each other. When they completed the three tasks, the guardian gave them a gift more precious than magic itself - the wisdom to use their powers for good, and the understanding that the greatest magic is that which brings hearts together and builds bridges between people. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗﻘدم (Advanced Level) اﻟﺗﺎج اﻟﻣﻠﻌون Description: A dark fantasy exploring themes of power corruption, moral decay, and the true cost of unlimited power, told through rich symbolism and complex character development. ﻓﻲ ﻣﻣﻠﻛﺔ ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ ﺗﺣﯾط ﺑﮭﺎ اﻟﺟﺑﺎل اﻟﺷﺎھﻘﺔ واﻟﻐﺎﺑﺎت اﻟﺳﺣرﯾﺔ، ﺣﻛم ﻣﻠك ﺷﺎب ﯾدﻋﻰ . ﻓﯾﺻل ﻛﺎن ﺣﻛﯾﻣﺎً وﻋﺎدﻻً ﻓﻲ ﺑداﯾﺔ ﺣﻛﻣﮫ، ﻟﻛن ﻗﻠﺑﮫ ﻛﺎن ﯾﺗوق داﺋﻣﺎً ﻟﻠﻣزﯾد ﻣن . اﻟﻘوة ﻓﻲ أﺣد اﻷﯾﺎم، ﺳﻣﻊ ﻋن ﺗﺎج أﺳطوري ﻣﺧﺑﺄ ﻓﻲ ﻣﻌﺑد ﻣﻧﺳﻲ، ﯾﻘﺎل إﻧﮫ ﯾﻣﻧﺢ ﻗوة ﻻ ﺣدود ﻟﮭﺎ ﻟﻣن ﯾرﺗدﯾﮫ . رﻏم ﺗﺣذﯾرات ﻣﺳﺗﺷﺎرﯾﮫ وﺗوﺳﻼت زوﺟﺗﮫ اﻟﻣﻠﻛﺔ ﻧور، ﻗرر ﻓﯾﺻل اﻟﺑﺣث ﻋن . اﻟﺗﺎج ﻗﺎده ﺑﺣﺛﮫ ﻋﺑر ﻣﺧﺎطر ﻛﺛﯾرة، ﺣﺗﻰ وﺟد اﻟﻣﻌﺑد اﻟﻣﻧﺳﻲ ﻓﻲ ﻗﻠب ﺟﺑل . ﻣظﻠم ﻛﺎن اﻟﺗﺎج ﯾﺗوھﺞ ﺑﺿوء أﺣﻣر ﻏﺎﻣض، ﻣﻧﻘوﺷﺎً ﺑرﻣوز ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ ﺗﺣذر ﻣن . ﻟﻌﻧﺗﮫ ﻟﻛن ﻓﯾﺻل، اﻟﻣﺳﻛون ﺑﺎﻟطﻣوح، ﺗﺟﺎھل اﻟﺗﺣذﯾرات ووﺿﻊ اﻟﺗﺎج ﻋﻠﻰ رأﺳﮫ . ﻓﻲ اﻟﺑداﯾﺔ، ﺑدت اﻟﻘوة . راﺋﻌﺔ اﺳﺗطﺎع ﺗﺣرﯾك اﻟﺟﺑﺎل وﺗﻐﯾﯾر ﻣﺟرى اﻷﻧﮭﺎر ﺑﻣﺟرد . اﻟﺗﻔﻛﯾر ﻟﻛن ﻣﻊ ﻛل ﻗوة ﺟدﯾدة، ﺑدأ ﻗﻠﺑﮫ ﯾﺗﺣول إﻟﻰ . ﺣﺟر ﻧﺳﻲ اﻟرﺣﻣﺔ واﻟﻌدل، وأﺻﺑﺢ طﺎﻏﯾﺔ ﯾﺧﺷﺎه . ﺷﻌﺑﮫ ﺣﺗﻰ اﻧﻌﻛﺎﺳﮫ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣرآة ﺑدأ ﯾﺗﻐﯾر، ﯾظﮭر اﻟظﻼم اﻟذي ﯾﻠﺗﮭم روﺣﮫ .

The Cursed Crown In an ancient kingdom surrounded by towering mountains and magical forests, ruled by a young king named Faisal. He was wise and just at the beginning of his reign, but his heart always yearned for more power. One day, he heard of a legendary crown hidden in a forgotten temple, said to grant limitless power to its wearer. Despite his advisors' warnings and the pleading of his wife, Queen Noor, Faisal decided to search for the crown. His quest led him through many dangers until he found the forgotten temple in the heart of a dark mountain. The crown glowed with a mysterious red light, inscribed with ancient symbols warning of its curse. But Faisal, possessed by ambition, ignored the warnings and placed the crown upon his head. At ﬁrst, the power seemed wonderful. He could move mountains and change the course of rivers with mere thoughts. But with each new power, his heart began turning to stone. He forgot mercy and justice, becoming a tyrant feared by his people. Even his reﬂection in mirrors began to change, showing the darkness consuming his soul. Queen Noor, watching her husband transform into a monster, began searching for a solution. She discovered that the crown could only be destroyed by a sacriﬁce born of pure love. In the ﬁnal confrontation, as Faisal was about to destroy the entire kingdom with his unbridled power, Noor willingly gave her life, shattering the crown and healing her husband's soul. Faisal awoke from his darkness to ﬁnd his kingdom in ruins and his wife gone, carrying an eternal lesson about the true price of absolute power. رﯾﺷﺔ اﻟﻌﻧﻘﺎء Description: An epic tale of a warrior's quest for immortality, exploring themes of mortality, sacriﬁce, and the true meaning of eternal life through rich Arabian folklore elements.

The Phoenix Feather At the edge of the known world, where desert meets sky, lived a warrior named Saif. He was renowned for his courage and wisdom, but was obsessed with the idea of immortality. He heard of an ancient legend about the golden phoenix feather, which grants its bearer eternal life, kept in the heart of the Eternal Fire Mountain. Saif began his perilous journey across the barren desert, facing sandstorms carrying evil spirits and blue ﬁre serpents guarding the path. In a mysterious oasis, he met an ancient sheikh who told him that immortality was not a gift, but a curse. Yet Saif, driven by his deep fear of death, continued his journey. When he reached the mountain, he found it blazing with undying ﬁres, rivers of lava ﬂowing from its crevices. At its peak, he saw the phoenix, a majestic creature of ﬁre and light, perpetually renewing itself. He asked for a feather, and it replied: "Each feather has a price. You must live a thousand years of memories in a single moment." Saif agreed, and was overwhelmed with visions of his potential future: he saw himself witnessing the death of everyone he loved, over and over. He saw himself wandering alone in a changing world he couldn't understand, carrying the weight of centuries of memories and losses. He realized that life is beautiful because it is ﬁnite, and that immortality might be the cruelest punishment. When he returned to consciousness, he was transformed. The phoenix smiled and said, "You have passed the true test. Immortality lies not in the length of life, but in the wisdom we leave behind." Saif returned home, carrying not the phoenix feather, but a deeper understanding of the meaning of life and death.

It started caring about Sarah's feelings and tried to cheer her up when she was sad. Sarah discovered that what seemed like a malfunction was actually the beginning of something beautiful - a soul learning how to feel. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗوﺳط (Intermediate Level) ظﺎھرة اﻟﺟﺎذﺑﯾﺔ Description: A thrilling scientiﬁc mystery that unravels into a ﬁrst-contact scenario, blending physics with extraterrestrial discovery. ﻓﻲ ﻣﻧطﻘﺔ ﻧﺎﺋﯾﺔ ﻣن ﺻﺣراء اﻟﻧﻔود، اﻛﺗﺷف ﻓرﯾق ﻣن اﻟﻌﻠﻣﺎء ظﺎھرة : ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﻣﻧطﻘﺔ ﺗﺗﺻرف ﻓﯾﮭﺎ اﻟﺟﺎذﺑﯾﺔ ﺑﺷﻛل ﻏﯾر . طﺑﯾﻌﻲ اﻷﺟﺳﺎم ﺗطﻔو وﺗﺳﻘط ﺑﺷﻛل ﻋﺷواﺋﻲ، واﻟزﻣن ﻧﻔﺳﮫ ﯾﺑدو . ﻣﺗذﺑذﺑﺎً ﻗﺎدت اﻟدﻛﺗورة ﻣﻧﻰ ﻓرﯾﻘﺎً دوﻟﯾﺎً ﻟدراﺳﺔ ھذه اﻟظﺎھرة، ﻣﺟﮭزﯾن ﺑﺄﺣدث اﻟﻣﻌدات اﻟﻌﻠﻣﯾﺔ . ﺧﻼل أﺑﺣﺎﺛﮭم، ﻻﺣظوا ﻧﻣطﺎً ﻓﻲ اﺿطراﺑﺎت اﻟﺟﺎذﺑﯾﺔ - ﻛﺄﻧﮭﺎ ﻧﺑﺿﺎت . ﻣﺷﻔرة ﺑﻌد أﺳﺎﺑﯾﻊ ﻣن اﻟﺗﺣﻠﯾل، ﺗوﺻﻠت ﻣﻧﻰ إﻟﻰ ﻧﺗﯾﺟﺔ : ﻣذھﻠﺔ اﻹﺷﺎرات ﻛﺎﻧت . رﺳﺎﺋل ﺗﺣت اﻟرﻣﺎل، اﻛﺗﺷﻔوا ﻗﺎﻋدة ﻓﺿﺎﺋﯾﺔ ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ، ﻣﺧﻔﯾﺔ ﻋن اﻷﻋﯾن ﻣﻧذ آﻻف اﻟﺳﻧﯾن، ﺗﻧﺑض ﺑطﺎﻗﺔ ﻏﺎﻣﺿﺔ . ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﻘﺎﻋدة ﺗﺳﺗﺧدم ﺗﻘﻧﯾﺔ ﺗﺗﻼﻋب ﺑﺎﻟﺟﺎذﺑﯾﺔ ﻟﻠﺗواﺻل ﻋﺑر . اﻟﻣﺟرات وﺑﯾﻧﻣﺎ ﺑدأ اﻟﻔرﯾق ﻓﻲ ﻓك رﻣوز اﻟرﺳﺎﺋل، أدرﻛوا أﻧﮭم ﻟﯾﺳوا وﺣدھم ﻓﻲ اﻟﻛون، وأن اﻷرض ﻛﺎﻧت داﺋﻣﺎً ﻣﺣطﺔ ﻓﻲ ﺷﺑﻛﺔ ﻛوﻧﯾﺔ أﻛﺑر ﺑﻛﺛﯾر ﻣﻣﺎ . ﺗﺧﯾﻠوا ﻣﻊ ﻛل اﻛﺗﺷﺎف ﺟدﯾد، ﺑرزت أﺳﺋﻠﺔ أﻛﺛر : إﻟﺣﺎﺣﺎً ﻣن ﺑﻧﻰ ھذه اﻟﻘﺎﻋدة؟ وھل ﺳﯾﻌودون ﯾوﻣﺎً؟ The Gravity Anomaly In a remote area of the Nefud Desert, a team of scientists discovered a strange phenomenon: a zone where gravity behaved unnaturally. Objects ﬂoated and fell randomly, and time itself seemed to ﬂuctuate. Dr. Muna led an international team to study this phenomenon, equipped with the latest scientiﬁc instruments. During their research, they noticed a pattern in the gravitational disturbances - like encoded pulses. After weeks of analysis, Muna reached an astounding conclusion: the signals were messages. Beneath the sands, they discovered an ancient alien base, hidden from sight for thousands of years, pulsing with mysterious energy.

The base used technology that manipulated gravity to communicate across galaxies. As the team began decoding the messages, they realized they weren't alone in the universe, and that Earth had always been a station in a cosmic network far larger than they had imagined. With each new discovery, more pressing questions emerged: who built this base? And would they ever return? اﻻﻧﺟراف اﻟﻌﺻﺑﻲ Description: A psychological thriller exploring the boundaries between human consciousness and artiﬁcial intelligence. طور اﻟﻣﺑرﻣﺞ ﻋﻣر ﺧوارزﻣﯾﺔ ﻣﺗﻘدﻣﺔ ﻟﻧﻘل اﻟوﻋﻲ اﻟﺑﺷري إﻟﻰ . اﻟﺣﺎﺳوب ﺑﻌد ﺳﻧوات ﻣن اﻟﺗﺟﺎرب اﻟﻧﺎﺟﺣﺔ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﺣﯾواﻧﺎت، ﻗرر أن ﯾﺧﺗﺑر اﺧﺗراﻋﮫ ﻋﻠﻰ . ﻧﻔﺳﮫ أﻧﺷﺄ ﻧﺳﺧﺔ رﻗﻣﯾﺔ ﻣن وﻋﯾﮫ وأطﻠﻘﮭﺎ ﻓﻲ ﺷﺑﻛﺔ اﻓﺗراﺿﯾﺔ ﻣﻌﻘدة، ﻣﺗوﻗﻌﺎً أن ﯾﺣﺗﻔظ ﺑﺎﻟﺳﯾطرة اﻟﻛﺎﻣﻠﺔ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﺗﺟرﺑﺔ . ﻓﻲ اﻟﺑداﯾﺔ، ﺑدا ﻛل ﺷﻲء ﯾﺳﯾر ﺣﺳب . اﻟﺧطﺔ اﺳﺗطﺎع ﻋﻣر اﻟﺗﻧﻘل ﺑﯾن ﻋﺎﻟﻣﮫ اﻟﻣﺎدي واﻟرﻗﻣﻲ . ﺑﺳﮭوﻟﺔ ﻟﻛن ﻣﻊ ﻣرور اﻟوﻗت، ﺑدأت اﻟﺣدود ﺑﯾن اﻟﻌﺎﻟﻣﯾن . ﺗﺗﻼﺷﻰ أﺻﺑﺢ ﻣن اﻟﺻﻌب ﻋﻠﯾﮫ ﺗﻣﯾﯾز ذﻛرﯾﺎﺗﮫ اﻟﺣﻘﯾﻘﯾﺔ ﻣن ﺗﻠك . اﻟﻣﺻطﻧﻌﺔ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻌﺎﻟم اﻟرﻗﻣﻲ، اﻛﺗﺷف أﻧﮫ ﯾﺳﺗطﯾﻊ ﺗﻌدﯾل اﻟواﻗﻊ ﺑﻣﺟرد اﻟﺗﻔﻛﯾر، ﻣﻣﺎ ﺟﻌل اﻟﻌودة إﻟﻰ اﻟﻌﺎﻟم اﻟﺣﻘﯾﻘﻲ أﻗل ﺟﺎذﺑﯾﺔ . وﺑﯾﻧﻣﺎ ﻛﺎن ﯾﻐوص أﻋﻣق ﻓﻲ ﺗﺟرﺑﺗﮫ، ﺑدأ : ﯾﺷك ھل ھو ﺣﻘﺎً ﻓﻲ اﻟﻌﺎﻟم اﻟرﻗﻣﻲ اﻵن، أم أﻧﮫ ﻋﺎﻟق ﻓﻲ ﻋﺎﻟﻣﮫ اﻟﻣﺎدي ﯾﺣﻠم ﺑﻛل ھذا؟ وھل ﻣﺎ ﯾراه ﻣن ﺣوﻟﮫ ﺣﻘﯾﻘﻲ، أم ﻣﺟرد ﻣﺣﺎﻛﺎة ﻣﺛﺎﻟﯾﺔ؟ أﺻﺑﺢ اﻟﺑﺣث ﻋن اﻟﺣﻘﯾﻘﺔ رﺣﻠﺔ ﻓﻲ ﻣﺗﺎھﺔ ﻣن اﻟواﻗﻊ واﻟوھم . Neural Drift Programmer Omar developed an advanced algorithm for transferring human consciousness into computers. After years of successful animal trials, he decided to test his invention on himself. He created a digital copy of his consciousness and released it into a complex virtual network, expecting to maintain complete control over the experiment. Initially, everything seemed to go according to plan. Omar could move between his physical and digital worlds with ease. However, as time passed, the boundaries between the worlds began to blur. It became diﬃcult for him to distinguish his real memories from artiﬁcial ones. In the digital world, he discovered he could modify reality with mere thoughts, making returning to the real world less appealing. As he delved deeper into his experiment, he began to doubt: was he really in the digital world now, or was he stuck in his physical world dreaming all of this? And was what he saw around him real, or just a perfect simulation? The search for truth became a journey through a maze of reality and illusion.

The Quantum Key In a secret quantum physics laboratory, scientist Reem discovered a strange metallic key emanating mysterious energy. She didn't expect this key would open doors not to rooms, but to parallel universes. Each time she used the key, she found a diﬀerent version of her life - worlds where she made diﬀerent choices, lived other lives. In one world, she was a famous artist. In another, she was a prominent politician. But with each journey, she began noticing a disturbing pattern: each world paid a price for its happiness. In the world where she was a successful artist, she lost her family. Where she was a powerful politician, she lost her humanity. Reem tried to use her scientiﬁc knowledge to understand the key, but discovered it deﬁed all known laws of physics. Each journey left marks on the fabric of reality, creating small cracks between worlds. During one of her trips, she met another version of herself who was trying to close all the portals before the worlds collapsed into each other. Reem realized she had to make a decision: either continue exploring the inﬁnite possibilities of her life, or accept her world as it was and close the portals forever. In the end, she understood that life's value lies not in knowing what could have been, but in living deeply in the reality she chose.

The Final Spark In a world entirely dependent on a single eternal power source, engineer Layla lived in a city that glowed day and night. The "Beating Heart," as they called it, was a giant reactor that provided the whole world with inexhaustible energy. No one knew how it was built hundreds of years ago, but everyone relied on it for everything. Layla worked in the reactor monitoring unit, where she noticed subtle changes in energy rates. At ﬁrst, they were just small ﬂuctuations that only an expert could see. But after deep analysis of the data, she discovered a terrifying truth: the reactor wasn't inﬁnite as everyone believed. It was slowly depleting itself, and the world was headed for catastrophe. She tried to warn the authorities, but they refused to believe her. The world's economy and civilization were entirely dependent on the idea of inﬁnite energy. Layla decided to take matters into her own hands. She began secret research into alternative energy sources, using her engineering knowledge to develop sustainable solutions. 


--- Page 12 ---

As the reactor approached the point of no return, Layla faced a moral dilemma: should she reveal the truth to the world and risk societal collapse, or work silently to save what could be saved? In the end, she chose a middle path. She revealed her discoveries gradually, while oﬀering practical solutions. She taught the world a harsh lesson: even what seems inﬁnite has an end, and our future depends on understanding our limits.

The Antique Watch Nada bought an old brass pocket watch from an antique shop in old Damascus. The watch was beautiful with its intricate engravings and faded gold chain, but something strange was happening: every night at 11:17 PM, the watch would stop working for exactly one minute, then resume ticking as if nothing had happened. Nada began researching the watch's history. She discovered it dated back to 1947 and belonged to a wealthy merchant named Faris Al-Mansour, who disappeared under mysterious circumstances. One day, while cleaning the watch, she noticed a tiny engraving hidden inside the back cover pointing to an address in the old city. The address led her to an abandoned house in a narrow alley, its walls cracked and balconies eroded. There, at exactly 11:17, the watch began ticking in a strange rhythm, as if trying to tell a story. She consulted a local historian, Dr. Salim, who helped her search through old records and newspaper archives. Together they discovered that the merchant hadn't disappeared but was murdered at that exact time in his old oﬃce - the same place that was now the antique shop. The watch had witnessed a murder unsolved for seventy years, and stranger still, the killer's grandson still lived in the same neighborhood, carrying a secret inherited from his grandfather. اﻟﺟﺎر اﻟﺻﺎﻣت Description: A suspenseful tale of suburban mystery that uncovers unexpected truths about appearances and judgment. ﻛﺎن ﻋﻣر ﯾراﻗب ﺟﺎره اﻟﻐﺎﻣض ﻣﻧذ . أﺷﮭر اﻟﺳﯾد ﻛﻣﺎل، اﻟذي اﻧﺗﻘل ﺣدﯾﺛﺎً إﻟﻰ اﻟﺣﻲ اﻟﮭﺎدئ، ﻟم ﯾﻐﺎدر ﻣﻧزﻟﮫ أﺑداً ﺧﻼل . اﻟﻧﮭﺎر ﻛﺎﻧت اﻷﺿواء ﺗﺷﺗﻌل ﻓﻘط ﻓﻲ ﻣﻧﺗﺻف اﻟﻠﯾل، وﻛﺎن ﯾﺗﻠﻘﻰ طروداً ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﻓﻲ أوﻗﺎت . ﻣﺗﺄﺧرة ﺣﺗﻰ ﺣدﯾﻘﺗﮫ ﻛﺎﻧت ﻣﺧﺗﻠﻔﺔ - ﻣﻠﯾﺋﺔ ﺑﺄﺟﮭزة ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﺗﺻدر أﺻواﺗﺎً طﻧﺎﻧﺔ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻠﯾل . ﻗرر ﻋﻣر، اﻟﻣدﻓوع ﺑﻔﺿوﻟﮫ اﻟﻣراھق وﺷﻐﻔﮫ ﺑﺄﻓﻼم اﻟﺟرﯾﻣﺔ، اﻟﺗﺣﻘﯾق ﻓﻲ . اﻷﻣر ﺑدأ ﯾﻠﺗﻘط ﺻوراً وﯾدون ﻣﻼﺣظﺎت ﻋن ﺗﺣرﻛﺎت ﺟﺎره . اﻟﻠﯾﻠﯾﺔ ﻻﺣظ أن اﻟﺳﯾد ﻛﻣﺎل ﯾﺗﺣدث ﻣﻊ ﻧﻔﺳﮫ ﻓﻲ اﻟﺣدﯾﻘﺔ، وﯾﺣﻣل ﺻﻧﺎدﯾق ﺛﻘﯾﻠﺔ إﻟﻰ اﻟﻘﺑو، وﯾﺳﺗﻘﺑل زواراً ﻏﺎﻣﺿﯾن ﯾرﺗدون ﻣﻌﺎطف ﺳوداء . ﻓﻲ إﺣدى اﻟﻠﯾﺎﻟﻲ اﻟﻣﺎطرة، وﺑﯾﻧﻣﺎ ﻛﺎن ﯾﺗﺳﻠل ﻗرب ﻧﺎﻓذة اﻟﻘﺑو، اﻧزﻟﻘت ﻗدﻣﮫ . وﺳﻘط ﺑدﻻً ﻣن أن ﯾواﺟﮫ ﻏﺿب ﺟﺎره، ﻓوﺟﺊ ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﻓﺗﺢ اﻟﺳﯾد ﻛﻣﺎل اﻟﺑﺎب ﺑﺎﺑﺗﺳﺎﻣﺔ ودﻋﺎه . ﻟﻠدﺧول وھﻧﺎك، اﻛﺗﺷف اﻟﺣﻘﯾﻘﺔ اﻟﻣذھﻠﺔ . ﻛﺎن اﻟﺳﯾد ﻛﻣﺎل ﻋﺎﻟم ﻓﻠك ﻣرﻣوق ﯾدﯾر ﻣرﺻداً ﺳرﯾﺎً ﺗﺣت ﻣﻧزﻟﮫ، ﯾﺗﺗﺑﻊ إﺷﺎرات ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﻣن اﻟﻔﺿﺎء . اﻟﻌﻣﯾق اﻷﺟﮭزة ﻓﻲ اﻟﺣدﯾﻘﺔ ﻛﺎﻧت أﺟﮭزة اﺳﺗﺷﻌﺎر ﻣﺗطورة، واﻟزوار اﻟﻐﺎﻣﺿون ﻛﺎﻧوا ﻋﻠﻣﺎء ﻣن وﻛﺎﻟﺔ . اﻟﻔﺿﺎء ﻟم ﯾﻛن ﻣﺟرﻣﺎً، ﺑل ﻋﺎﻟﻣﺎً ﻣﻧﻌزﻻً ﻋﻠﻰ وﺷك اﻛﺗﺷﺎف ﻋﻼﻣﺎت ﺣﯾﺎة ﺧﺎرج اﻷرض .

The Silent Neighbor Omar had been watching his mysterious neighbor for months. Mr. Kamal, who recently moved to the quiet neighborhood, never left his house during daylight. The lights only came on at midnight, and he received strange packages at odd hours. Even his garden was diﬀerent - ﬁlled with strange devices that hummed in the night. Driven by teenage curiosity and his love for crime movies, Omar decided to investigate. He started taking photos and making notes about his neighbor's nocturnal movements. He noticed Mr. Kamal talking to himself in the garden, carrying heavy boxes to the basement, and receiving mysterious visitors in black coats. One rainy night, while sneaking near the basement window, he slipped and fell. Instead of facing his neighbor's anger, he was surprised when Mr. Kamal opened the door with a smile and invited him in. There, he discovered the astounding truth. Mr. Kamal was a prominent astronomer running a secret observatory beneath his house, tracking strange signals from deep space. The devices in the garden were sophisticated sensors, and the mysterious visitors were scientists from the space agency. He wasn't a criminal, but a reclusive scientist on the verge of discovering signs of extraterrestrial life. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗﻘدم (Advanced Level) ﺳرﻗﺔ اﻟﯾﺎﻗوت اﻷزرق Description: A sophisticated heist story that explores the consequences of greed and the supernatural. رﻏم ﻛل ﻣﮭﺎراﺗﮭﺎ ﻓﻲ اﻟﺳرﻗﺔ، ﻟم ﺗواﺟﮫ ﻟﯾﻠﻰ ﯾوﻣﺎً ﺗﺣدﯾﺎً ﻣﺛل ﯾﺎﻗوت دﻣﻌﺔ " ". اﻟﺑﺣر ﻛﺎن ﺣﺟراً أزرق ﻧﺎدراً ﻣﺣﻔوظﺎً ﻓﻲ ﻣﺗﺣف اﻟﻣدﯾﻧﺔ، ﺗﺣت ﺣراﺳﺔ ﻣﺷددة وأﻧظﻣﺔ إﻧذار . ﻣﺗطورة ﻟﻛن ﺑﻌد ﺷﮭور ﻣن اﻟﺗﺧطﯾط اﻟدﻗﯾق، ﻧﺟﺣت ﻓﻲ اﺧﺗراق ﻛل اﻷﻧظﻣﺔ اﻷﻣﻧﯾﺔ واﺳﺗﺑدال اﻟﺣﺟر اﻷﺻﻠﻲ ﺑﻧﺳﺧﺔ ﻣزﯾﻔﺔ . ﻓﻲ اﻟﻠﯾﻠﺔ اﻷوﻟﻰ ﺑﻌد اﻟﺳرﻗﺔ، ﺑدأت اﻷﺣداث . اﻟﻐرﯾﺑﺔ اﺳﺗﯾﻘظت ﻋﻠﻰ ﺻوت أﻣواج اﻟﺑﺣر ﻓﻲ ﺷﻘﺗﮭﺎ ﺑوﺳط . اﻟﻣدﯾﻧﺔ رأت ﻗطرات ﻣﺎء ﻣﺎﻟﺢ ﺗﺗﺷﻛل ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﺟدران، وأﺣﻼم ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﻋن ﻏرﻗﻰ ﯾﻧﺎدﯾﮭﺎ ﻣن أﻋﻣﺎق . اﻟﻣﺣﯾط ﻛﻠﻣﺎ ﺣﺎوﻟت اﻻﺑﺗﻌﺎد ﻋن اﻟﯾﺎﻗوت، ﺟذﺑﮭﺎ إﻟﯾﮫ ﺑﻘوة ﻏﺎﻣﺿﺔ . ﺑﺣﺛت ﻓﻲ ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ اﻟﺣﺟر، واﻛﺗﺷﻔت أﺳطورة . ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ ﻛﺎن اﻟﯾﺎﻗوت ﺟزءاً ﻣن ﺗﺎج ﻣﻠﻛﺔ ﻏﺎرﻗﺔ، وﻛل ﻣن ﺳرﻗﮫ واﺟﮫ ﻣﺻﯾراً . ﻣﺄﺳﺎوﯾﺎً ﺣﺎوﻟت ﺑﯾﻊ اﻟﺣﺟر، ﻟﻛن ﻛل اﻟﻣﺷﺗرﯾن اﻟﻣﺣﺗﻣﻠﯾن ﻣﺎﺗوا ﻓﻲ ﺣوادث ﻏﺎﻣﺿﺔ ﺗﺗﻌﻠق . ﺑﺎﻟﻣﺎء ﺣﺗﻰ أﺻدﻗﺎؤھﺎ اﻟﻣﻘرﺑﯾن ﺑدأوا ﯾﺧﺗﻔون واﺣداً ﺗﻠو اﻵﺧر .

The Sapphire Heist Despite all her theft skills, Layla had never faced a challenge like the "Sea's Tear" sapphire. It was a rare blue stone kept in the city museum, under heavy guard and sophisticated alarm systems. But after months of meticulous planning, she succeeded in bypassing all security systems and replacing the original stone with a fake. On the ﬁrst night after the theft, strange events began. She awoke to the sound of ocean waves in her downtown apartment. She saw saltwater droplets forming on the walls, and strange dreams of drowned people calling her from the ocean depths. Every time she tried to distance herself from the sapphire, it drew her back with a mysterious force. She researched the stone's history and discovered an ancient legend. The sapphire was part of a drowned queen's crown, and everyone who stole it met a tragic fate. She tried to sell the stone, but all potential buyers died in mysterious water-related accidents. Even her close friends began disappearing one after another. Layla realized she was trapped. Either return the stone and face prison, or keep it and face its curse. In a moment of desperation, she decided to dive deep into its secrets, only to discover that the sapphire wasn't just a gemstone, but a key to a mysterious underwater world, and its theft was just the beginning of an adventure far bigger than she had imagined. اﻟظل ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟدرج Description: A haunting tale of family secrets, guilt, and the supernatural that blurs the line between past and present. ﺑدأت ﻟﯾﺎﻟﻲ رﻧﺎ ﺗﺗﺣول إﻟﻰ ﻛﺎﺑوس ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣﻧزل اﻟﻘدﯾم اﻟذي ورﺛﺗﮫ ﻋن . ﺟدﺗﮭﺎ ﻛل ﻟﯾﻠﺔ، ﻓﻲ ﺗﻣﺎم اﻟﺳﺎﻋﺔ اﻟﺛﺎﻟﺛﺔ ﺻﺑﺎﺣﺎً، ﺗﺳﻣﻊ وﻗﻊ ﺧطوات ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟدرج اﻟﺧﺷﺑﻲ . اﻟﻘدﯾم ﺻوت ﺧطوات ﺑطﯾﺋﺔ، ﻣﺗﺄﻧﯾﺔ، ﺗﺻﻌد درﺟﺔ ﺗﻠو اﻷﺧرى، ﺛم ﺗﺗوﻗف ﻋﻧد ﺑﺎب . ﻏرﻓﺗﮭﺎ ﻟﻛن ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗﻔﺗﺢ اﻟﺑﺎب، ﻻ ﺗﺟد أﺣداً . ﺣﺎوﻟت ﺗﺟﺎھل اﻷﻣر ﻓﻲ . اﻟﺑداﯾﺔ رﻛﺑت ﻛﺎﻣﯾرات ﻣراﻗﺑﺔ، واﺳﺗدﻋت ﺧﺑﯾراً ﻟﻠﻛﺷف ﻋن أي ﺧﻠل ﻓﻲ اﻷرﺿﯾﺔ اﻟﺧﺷﺑﯾﺔ . اﻟﻘدﯾﻣﺔ ﻟﻛن اﻟﻛﺎﻣﯾرات ﻟم ﺗﻠﺗﻘط ﺷﯾﺋﺎً، رﻏم اﺳﺗﻣرار اﻟﺧطوات ﻛل . ﻟﯾﻠﺔ ﺑدأت ﺗﺑﺣث ﻓﻲ ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ اﻟﻣﻧزل وﻣﺎﺿﻲ ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺗﮭﺎ .

The Shadow on the Stairs Rana's nights began turning into a nightmare in the old house she inherited from her grandmother. Every night, at exactly 3 AM, she would hear footsteps on the old wooden staircase. Slow, deliberate footsteps, climbing one step at a time, then stopping at her bedroom door. But when she opened the door, no one was there. She tried ignoring it at ﬁrst. She installed security cameras and called an expert to check for any defects in the old wooden ﬂooring. But the cameras captured nothing, despite the footsteps continuing every night. She began researching the house's history and her family's past. In an old box in the attic, she found her grandmother's diaries. The yellowed pages revealed a dark secret: ﬁfty years ago, a little girl disappeared in the house. She was the maid's daughter, and according to the diaries, she would climb the stairs every night to fetch medicine for her sick mother. One night, she vanished and was never found. As she delved deeper into the story, Rana began noticing changes in herself. She started waiting for the footsteps each night, feeling the little girl's presence. One night, she decided to follow the footsteps. She opened the door before they stopped, ﬁnding herself face to face with a truth she wasn't ready for: the girl hadn't just disappeared, but the family had played a role in her disappearance, and the footsteps were echoes of an unsolved crime, waiting for someone to uncover the truth.

Secrets of the Forgotten Island The sailors awoke on the shore of an unknown island after their ship sank in a violent storm. The island appeared beautiful at ﬁrst glance, with its white beaches and dense forests, but they soon discovered they weren't alone. At night, mysterious lights danced between the trees, and strange sounds echoed across the island. The crew's captain, Ahmed, found ancient inscriptions on the walls of a nearby cave. The inscriptions told the story of an ancient civilization that lived on the island and suddenly disappeared due to a supernatural force. As days passed, the sailors began noticing strange occurrences: tools moving by themselves, footprints appearing and disappearing in the sand, and whispers in the air. Ahmed and his crew decided to explore the heart of the island, where they discovered an ancient temple covered in climbing vines. Inside the temple, they uncovered the island's secret: it was home to spectral beings protecting an ancient treasure. As they came to understand the island's history and inhabitants, they learned to coexist with these beings until they could repair their ship and return home. 2. ﻟؤﻟؤة اﻟﺻﺣراء اﻟﺳﺣرﯾﺔ (The Magical Desert Pearl) Description: A merchant's race against time through the mystical desert in search of a legendary pearl. اﻧطﻠق اﻟﺗﺎﺟر ﻛرﯾم ﻓﻲ رﺣﻠﺔ ﻣﺣﻔوﻓﺔ ﺑﺎﻟﻣﺧﺎطر ﻋﺑر اﻟﺻﺣراء اﻟﺷﺎﺳﻌﺔ ﺑﺣﺛﺎً ﻋن ﻟؤﻟؤة . أﺳطورﯾﺔ ﺗﻘول اﻷﺳﺎطﯾر إن ھذه اﻟﻠؤﻟؤة ﺗﻣﻧﺢ ﺣﺎﻣﻠﮭﺎ اﻟﻘدرة ﻋﻠﻰ ﺗﺣﻘﯾق أﻣﻧﯾﺔ واﺣدة، ﻟﻛن ﯾﺟب اﻟﻌﺛور ﻋﻠﯾﮭﺎ ﻗﺑل اﻛﺗﻣﺎل اﻟﻘﻣر ﻓﻲ ﻟﯾﻠﺔ اﻟﺻﯾف . واﺟﮫ ﻛرﯾم اﻟﻌدﯾد ﻣن اﻟﺗﺣدﯾﺎت ﻓﻲ : رﺣﻠﺗﮫ ﻋواﺻف رﻣﻠﯾﺔ ﻋﺎﺗﯾﺔ، وواﺣﺎت ﺧﺎدﻋﺔ، وﻗطﺎع طرق ﯾﺑﺣﺛون ﻋن ﻧﻔس . اﻟﻛﻧز ﻟﻛن اﻷﺻﻌب ﻣن ذﻟك ﻛﻠﮫ ﻛﺎن ﻋﻠﯾﮫ ﻣواﺟﮭﺔ ﺣﺎرس اﻟﻠؤﻟؤة - ﻋﻔرﯾت ﻗدﯾم ﯾﺧﺗﺑر ﻧواﯾﺎ ﻛل ﻣن ﯾﺳﻌﻰ ﻟﻠﺣﺻول ﻋﻠﯾﮭﺎ . ﻓﻲ اﻟﻠﺣظﺔ اﻷﺧﯾرة ﻗﺑل اﻛﺗﻣﺎل اﻟﻘﻣر، وﺻل ﻛرﯾم إﻟﻰ ﻣﺧﺑﺄ اﻟﻠؤﻟؤة ﻓﻲ ﻗﻠب ﺟﺑل ﻣن . اﻟﻛرﯾﺳﺗﺎل واﺟﮫ اﻟﻌﻔرﯾت اﻟذي طرح ﻋﻠﯾﮫ : ﻟﻐزاً ﻣﺎ " اﻟذي ﯾزداد ﻗﯾﻣﺔ ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗﺷﺎرﻛﮫ ﻣﻊ " اﻵﺧرﯾن؟ أﺟﺎب : ﻛرﯾم ". اﻟﺳﻌﺎدة " اﺑﺗﺳم اﻟﻌﻔرﯾت وﺳﻠﻣﮫ اﻟﻠؤﻟؤة، ﻟﻛن ﻛرﯾم ﻗرر اﺳﺗﺧداﻣﮭﺎ ﻟﻣﺳﺎﻋدة ﻗرﯾﺗﮫ اﻟﺗﻲ ﻛﺎﻧت ﺗﻌﺎﻧﻲ ﻣن اﻟﺟﻔﺎف، ﺑدﻻً ﻣن ﺗﺣﻘﯾق رﻏﺑﺎﺗﮫ اﻟﺷﺧﺻﯾﺔ .

Kareem faced many challenges on his journey: violent sandstorms, deceptive oases, and bandits searching for the same treasure. But the most diﬃcult of all was facing the pearl's guardian - an ancient djinn who tests the intentions of all who seek it. In the ﬁnal moment before the full moon, Kareem reached the pearl's hiding place in the heart of a crystal mountain. He faced the djinn who posed a riddle: "What becomes more valuable when shared with others?" Kareem answered: "Happiness." The djinn smiled and handed him the pearl, but Kareem decided to use it to help his drought-stricken village, rather than fulﬁll his personal desires. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗﻘدم (Advanced Level) 1. ﻗراﺻﻧﺔ اﻟﺳﻣﺎء (Pirates of the Sky) Description: An orphan's thrilling journey with a crew of sky pirates that challenges their understanding of loyalty and justice. ﻋﺛر ﯾﺎﺳﯾن، اﻟﻔﺗﻰ اﻟﯾﺗﯾم ذو اﻟﺧﻣﺳﺔ ﻋﺷر ﻋﺎﻣﺎً، ﻋﻠﻰ ﻧﻔﺳﮫ ﻓﻲ ﻣوﻗف ﻏﯾر ﻣﺗوﻗﻊ ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗﺳﻠل إﻟﻰ ﺳﻔﯾﻧﺔ ھواﺋﯾﺔ ﺿﺧﻣﺔ ﻛﺎن ﯾظﻧﮭﺎ ﻣﺟرد ﺳﻔﯾﻧﺔ ﺷﺣن . ﻋﺎدﯾﺔ اﻛﺗﺷف ﻻﺣﻘﺎً أﻧﮭﺎ ﺗﻧﺗﻣﻲ إﻟﻰ أﺷﮭر ﻗراﺻﻧﺔ اﻟﺳﻣﺎء ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣﻧطﻘﺔ - طﺎﻗم ﻧﺳور " " اﻟﻔﺟر ﺑﻘﯾﺎدة اﻟﻘﺎﺋدة ﺳﺎرة اﻟﺟﺳورة . ﺑدﻻً ﻣن إﻟﻘﺎﺋﮫ ﻣن اﻟﺳﻔﯾﻧﺔ، رأت ﺳﺎرة ﻓﻲ ﻋﯾﻧﯾﮫ ﺷرارة اﻟﻣﻐﺎﻣرة ذاﺗﮭﺎ اﻟﺗﻲ ﺗﺷﺗﻌل ﻓﻲ ﻗﻠوب . طﺎﻗﻣﮭﺎ ﻗررت ﻣﻧﺣﮫ ﻓرﺻﺔ ﻟﯾﺛﺑت ﺟدارﺗﮫ ﻛﻌﺿو ﻓﻲ . اﻟطﺎﻗم ﺗﻌﻠم ﯾﺎﺳﯾن ﻓﻧون اﻟﻣﻼﺣﺔ اﻟﺟوﯾﺔ، وإﺻﻼح اﻟﻣﺣرﻛﺎت اﻟﺑﺧﺎرﯾﺔ، واﻟﻘﺗﺎل . ﺑﺎﻟﺳﯾف ﻟﻛن أھم درس ﺗﻌﻠﻣﮫ ﻛﺎن أن اﻟﻘراﺻﻧﺔ ﯾﺗﺑﻌون ﻣدوﻧﺔ ﺷرف : ﺻﺎرﻣﺔ ﻻ ﯾﺳرﻗون ﻣن اﻟﻔﻘراء، وﯾﺳﺎﻋدون اﻟﻣﺣﺗﺎﺟﯾن، وﯾﻘﻔون ﻓﻲ وﺟﮫ اﻟظﻠم . ﻓﻲ ﻣﮭﻣﺗﮭم اﻷﺧﯾرة، اﻛﺗﺷف اﻟطﺎﻗم ﻣؤاﻣرة : ﺧطﯾرة ﺗﺎﺟر ﺛري ﯾﺧطط ﻻﺣﺗﻛﺎر إﻣدادات اﻟﻐذاء ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣدن . اﻟﻌﺎﺋﻣﺔ ﻗرر ﯾﺎﺳﯾن اﻟﻣﺧﺎطرة ﺑﺣﯾﺎﺗﮫ ﻟﻠﺗﺳﻠل إﻟﻰ ﻗﻠﻌﺔ اﻟﺗﺎﺟر وﺳرﻗﺔ اﻟوﺛﺎﺋق اﻟﺗﻲ . ﺗدﯾﻧﮫ ﻧﺟﺣت اﻟﻣﮭﻣﺔ، ﻟﻛﻧﮭﺎ ﻛﺷﻔت ﻟﮫ ﺣﻘﯾﻘﺔ ﺻﺎدﻣﺔ - اﻟﺗﺎﺟر ﻛﺎن ﻣﺳؤوﻻً ﻋن ﺣرﯾق دار اﻷﯾﺗﺎم اﻟذي ﻗﺗل ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺗﮫ ﻗﺑل ﺳﻧوات . Pirates of the Sky Yaseen, a ﬁfteen-year-old orphan, found himself in an unexpected situation when he snuck aboard a massive airship he thought was just an ordinary cargo vessel. He later discovered it belonged to the region's most famous sky pirates - the Dawn Eagles crew, led by the fearless Captain Sara. Instead of throwing him overboard, Sara saw in his eyes the same spark of adventure that burned in her crew's hearts. She decided to give him a chance to prove his worth as a crew member. Yaseen learned the arts of aerial navigation, steam engine repair, and sword ﬁghting. But the most important lesson he learned was that pirates follow a strict code of honor: never steal from the poor, help those in need, and stand against injustice. On their latest mission, the crew discovered a dangerous conspiracy: a wealthy merchant planning to monopolize food supplies in the ﬂoating cities. Yaseen decided to risk his life to inﬁltrate the merchant's fortress and steal incriminating

Layla carried an ancient map inherited from her grandmother, a famous scientist who disappeared in this valley decades ago. With each step in the valley, she began to understand why so many had vanished here. The crystals pulsed with mysterious energy, drawing explorers into the valley's depths, revealing visions of the past and future. At the valley's heart, Layla discovered an ancient temple built entirely of black crystal. On its walls, she found her grandmother's journals etched into the crystal - she had discovered that the crystals contained the knowledge of an ancient civilization and decided to stay in the valley to protect its secrets. Layla faced a diﬃcult choice: return to the world with this amazing discovery, or stay like her grandmother to protect the valley's secrets from those who would abuse its power.

The Phantom Passenger On a cold winter night, Khaled was driving his taxi through the quiet city streets. He had started his night shift hours ago, and a light rain was falling on the car's windshield, adding a gloomy atmosphere to the deserted streets. At exactly midnight, the car's digital clock suddenly stopped. At that moment, Khaled spotted a man wearing a black coat standing in the darkness, signaling him to stop. The passenger's face was unnaturally pale, and his clothes seemed old-fashioned, as if from the 1950s. The passenger requested to go to the old city cemetery. During the journey, Khaled noticed several disturbing things: the man had no reﬂection in the rearview mirror, his breath left no fog on the window despite the severe cold, and his voice seemed to come from far away. The passenger began telling a strange story about a car accident that happened on the same night ﬁfty years ago. He was the driver, and in an attempt to avoid a child who suddenly crossed the road, he swerved and crashed into a tree. "Every year, on the same night, I try to return to the cemetery... to thank the child who survived." When they reached the cemetery, Khaled turned back to ask for the fare, but the back seat was empty, leaving only a patch of frost and an old yellow funeral ticket dated exactly ﬁfty years ago. On a nearby gravestone, Khaled saw his passenger's photo on the tombstone. 2. اﻟﺑورﺗرﯾﮫ اﻟﻣﺑﺗﺳم (The Grinning Portrait) Description: A seemingly innocent painting reveals a terrifying supernatural presence that threatens a family's sanity and safety. اﺷﺗرت ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺔ اﻟﻌﻣري ﻟوﺣﺔ ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ ﻣن ﻣﺗﺟر ﻟﻠﺗﺣف ﻓﻲ ﺣﻲ اﻟﻣدﯾﻧﺔ . اﻟﻘدﯾم ﻛﺎن ﺻﺎﺣب اﻟﻣﺗﺟر ﻣﺗردداً ﻓﻲ ﺑﯾﻌﮭﺎ، ﻟﻛﻧﮫ اﺳﺗﺳﻠم أﺧﯾراً ﺑﻌد إﺻرار اﻷب . ﻣﺣﻣد ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﻠوﺣﺔ ﺗﺻور رﺟﻼً ﻧﺑﯾﻼً ﻣن اﻟﻘرن اﻟﻣﺎﺿﻲ ﺑﺗﻌﺑﯾر ﺟﺎد ﻋﻠﻰ وﺟﮭﮫ، ﯾرﺗدي ﺑدﻟﺔ ﺳوداء أﻧﯾﻘﺔ وﯾﺟﻠس ﻓﻲ ﻛرﺳﻲ ﻣﺧﻣﻠﻲ أﺣﻣر . ﻋﻠﻘوا اﻟﻠوﺣﺔ ﻓﻲ ﻏرﻓﺔ اﻟﻣﻌﯾﺷﺔ، وﺑدت إﺿﺎﻓﺔ أﻧﯾﻘﺔ . ﻟﻠﻣﻧزل ﻟﻛن ﺑﻌد أﺳﺑوع، ﻻﺣظت ﻟﯾﻠﻰ، اﻻﺑﻧﺔ اﻟﺻﻐرى، أن ﺷﯾﺋﺎً ﻗد ﺗﻐﯾر - زواﯾﺎ ﻓم اﻟرﺟل ﺑدأت ﺗرﺗﻔﻊ . ﻗﻠﯾﻼً ﻓﻲ اﻟﺑداﯾﺔ، ﻟم ﯾﺻدﻗﮭﺎ . أﺣد ﻟﻛن أﺧﺎھﺎ أﺣﻣد ﺑدأ ﯾﻠﺗﻘط ﺻوراً ﯾوﻣﯾﺔ ﻟﻠوﺣﺔ، ﯾوﺛق اﻟﺗﻐﯾﯾر اﻟﺑطﻲء .

The Grinning Portrait The Al-Omari family bought an old painting from an antique shop in the old city district. The shop owner was hesitant to sell it, but ﬁnally gave in after Mohammed, the father, insisted. The painting depicted a nobleman from the last century with a serious expression, wearing an elegant black suit and sitting in a red velvet chair. They hung the painting in the living room, and it seemed an elegant addition to the house. But after a week, Layla, the youngest daughter, noticed something had changed - the corners of the man's mouth had begun to turn up slightly. At ﬁrst, no one believed her. But her brother Ahmed started taking daily photos of the painting, documenting the slow change. Each night, the smile grew wider, until it transformed into a frightening grin revealing sharp teeth. The family began hearing faint laughter at night, and footsteps in the hallway leading to the living room. The mother tried to remove the painting but received cold burns on her hands. Mohammed tried hiding the painting in the garage, but it appeared the next morning hanging in its original place. One night, the family awoke to deep laughter echoing through the house. They rushed to the living room to ﬁnd the painting empty - with the man standing in the corner of the room, wearing his terrifying smile. At that moment, they discovered the horrifying truth in old records: the house had belonged to him a hundred years ago, and he was known for his dark magical practices. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗﻘدم (Advanced Level) 1. اﻟﻐرﻓﺔ اﻟﺑﺎردة (The Cold Room) Description: A haunting exploration of an impossible room that bridges our world with something ancient and malevolent. ﻓﻲ ﻣﻧزل اﻟﻌﺎﺋﻠﺔ اﻟﻘدﯾم، ﻛﺎﻧت ھﻧﺎك ﻏرﻓﺔ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻘﺑو ﺗﺗﺣدى ﻛل ﻗواﻧﯾن . اﻟطﺑﯾﻌﺔ ﺣﺗﻰ ﻓﻲ أﺷد أﯾﺎم اﻟﺻﯾف ﺣرارة، ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗﺻل درﺟﺔ اﻟﺣرارة إﻟﻰ أرﺑﻌﯾن درﺟﺔ ﻣﺋوﯾﺔ، ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﻐرﻓﺔ ﺑﺎردة . ﻛﺎﻟﺛﻠﺞ ﺣﺎول اﻟﻣﮭﻧدﺳون واﻟﺧﺑراء ﺗﻔﺳﯾر اﻟظﺎھرة، ﻟﻛن دون . ﺟدوى أﺟﮭزة ﻗﯾﺎس اﻟﺣرارة ﺗﻌطﻠت، وﻛﺎﻣﯾرات اﻟﻣراﻗﺑﺔ ﺗوﻗﻔت ﻋن اﻟﻌﻣل ﺑﻣﺟرد دﺧوﻟﮭﺎ . اﻟﻐرﻓﺔ اﻟﺗﻛﻧوﻟوﺟﯾﺎ اﻟﺣدﯾﺛﺔ ﻋﺟزت ﻋن ﺗﻔﺳﯾر ھذا اﻟﺑرد اﻟﻐﯾر طﺑﯾﻌﻲ . ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ورث ﺳﺎﻣر اﻟﻣﻧزل ﻋن ﻋﻣﮫ، ﻗرر ﺣل ھذا . اﻟﻠﻐز ﻛﺎن ﻋﺎﻟم آﺛﺎر ﻣﺗﺧﺻﺻﺎً ﻓﻲ اﻟﺣﺿﺎرات اﻟﻘدﯾﻣﺔ، وﺷﻌر أن ھﻧﺎك ﺷﯾﺋﺎً أﻋﻣق ﻣن ﻣﺟرد ﺧﻠل ﻓﻲ درﺟﺔ . اﻟﺣرارة ﺑدأ ﯾﻘﺿﻲ ﺳﺎﻋﺎت ﻓﻲ اﻟﻐرﻓﺔ، ﯾﺳﺟل ﻣﻼﺣظﺎﺗﮫ . وﻣﻼﺣظﺎﺗﮫ ﻓﻲ اﻟﺑداﯾﺔ، ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﮭﻣﺳﺎت ﺧﺎﻓﺗﺔ - أﺻوات ﺑﺎﻟﻛﺎد ﻣﺳﻣوﻋﺔ ﺗﺗردد ﻓﻲ . اﻟﺟدران ﻣﻊ ﻣرور اﻟوﻗت، أﺻﺑﺣت اﻷﺻوات أوﺿﺢ، وﺑدأت ﺗظﮭر ﻧﻘوش ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﻋﻠﻰ اﻟﺟدران .

The Cold Room In the old family house, there was a basement room that deﬁed all laws of nature. Even on the hottest summer days, when temperatures reached forty degrees Celsius, the room remained ice-cold. Engineers and experts tried to explain the phenomenon, but to no avail. Thermometers malfunctioned, and surveillance cameras stopped working as soon as they entered the room. Modern technology failed to explain this unnatural cold. When Samer inherited the house from his uncle, he decided to solve this mystery. As an archaeologist specializing in ancient civilizations, he felt there was something deeper than just a temperature anomaly. He began spending hours in the room, recording his observations. At ﬁrst, the whispers were faint - barely audible sounds echoing in the walls. Over time, the voices became clearer, and strange inscriptions began appearing on the walls. The writings were in ancient Sumerian, but Samer gradually began to understand them. They spoke of a gateway between worlds, and of ancient beings imprisoned behind a thin barrier of reality. He discovered that the house was built over an ancient temple, and the room was a point of contact with another world. The cold was merely a symptom of these beings' presence. On the ﬁnal night of his research, when the temperature dropped far below zero, the walls began to crack. New writings appeared, glowing with a cold blue light, and Samer heard a deep voice say, "Finally, we found someone who understands our language. We have been waiting for thousands of years." Then Samer realized that his understanding of the texts wasn't just translation - it was an ancient ritual to open the gateway. 2. اﻟزاﺋر اﻟﻠﯾﻠﻲ (The Midnight Visitor) Description: A terrifying entity stalks a small town, turning a simple act of answering the door into a deadly game of survival. ﺑدأت اﻟظﺎھرة اﻟﻐرﯾﺑﺔ ﻓﻲ ﻗرﯾﺔ اﻟﺻﻧوﺑر اﻟﮭﺎدﺋﺔ ﻓﻲ ﻟﯾﻠﺔ ﺷﺗﺎء . ﻗﺎرﺳﺔ طرﻗﺎت ﻋﻠﻰ اﻷﺑواب ﻓﻲ ﻣﻧﺗﺻف اﻟﻠﯾل، داﺋﻣﺎً ﻓﻲ ﺗﻣﺎم اﻟﺳﺎﻋﺔ اﻟﺛﺎﻧﯾﺔ . ﻋﺷرة وھؤﻻء اﻟذﯾن ﯾﻔﺗﺣون أﺑواﺑﮭم ﯾﺧﺗﻔون دون أﺛر، ﺗﺎرﻛﯾن ﺧﻠﻔﮭم ﻣﻧﺎزل ﺧﺎﻟﯾﺔ وراﺋﺣﺔ ﻏرﯾﺑﺔ ﺗﺷﺑﮫ راﺋﺣﺔ اﻟﺗراب اﻟﻣﺑﻠل . ﻛﺎﻧت ﺳﻧﺎء، ﻣﻌﻠﻣﺔ اﻟﺗﺎرﯾﺦ ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣدرﺳﺔ اﻟﺛﺎﻧوﯾﺔ، أول ﻣن ﺑدأ ﯾرﺑط ﺑﯾن . اﻷﺣداث ﻻﺣظت أن ﻧﻣط اﻻﺧﺗﻔﺎء ﯾﺗﺑﻊ ﻣﺳﺎراً ﻣﺣدداً، ﻛﺄن اﻟزاﺋر ﯾﺗﺑﻊ ﺧرﯾطﺔ . ﻗدﯾﻣﺔ ﺑدأت ﺗﺑﺣث ﻓﻲ ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ اﻟﻘرﯾﺔ، وﻓﻲ اﻟﺳﺟﻼت اﻟﻘدﯾﻣﺔ اﻛﺗﺷﻔت ﻗﺻﺔ ﻣروﻋﺔ ﻋن طﻘس ﻗدﯾم ﯾﺗطﻠب ﺗﺿﺣﯾﺎت ﺑﺷرﯾﺔ ﻹرﺿﺎء ﻛﯾﺎن ﻗدﯾم ﯾﺳﻛن ﺗﺣت اﻷرض .

The Midnight Visitor The strange phenomenon began in the quiet village of Al-Sanoubar on a bitter winter night. Knocks on doors at midnight, always exactly at twelve o'clock. And those who opened their doors vanished without a trace, leaving behind empty houses and a strange smell like wet earth. Sana, a history teacher at the high school, was the ﬁrst to connect the events. She noticed that the disappearance pattern followed a speciﬁc path, as if the visitor was following an ancient map. As she researched the village's history, she discovered in old records a horrifying story about an ancient ritual requiring human sacriﬁces to appease an entity dwelling beneath the earth. As the visitor approached her house, Sana spent her nights studying ancient manuscripts. Finally, on the night before her turn for a visit, she discovered the secret. The knocks weren't an invitation, but a test. Those who opened their doors were accepting an invisible invitation to join the world of darkness. When the knocks came at her door, exactly at midnight, Sana didn't open it. Instead, she stood silently reciting the ancient spell she had found. She heard a muﬄed scream from the other side and felt intense cold seeping under the door. The next morning, she found a mark carved into her doorstep - the mark of survival. Since that night, the midnight visits in Al-Sanoubar village stopped, but Sana knows the entity is still there, waiting for someone to open their door.

The Forgotten Song Nader stopped performing years ago after his last album failed. He was walking in the old city streets when he heard a familiar sound - a young man singing his old song "Tale of Rain" in a completely diﬀerent way. He stood listening, amazed at how this new version gave new life to his words. He met the young performer, Yasser, who learned the song from his grandmother. She would listen to it in the hospital during her cancer treatment, saying the song gave her hope. Nader began tracking his song's journey, discovering how it touched people's hearts in ways he never imagined. He returned to music, but this time not seeking fame, but to share the stories his song had gathered over the years. اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗوﺳط (Intermediate Level) [Continuing with longer versions] 2. اﻟﻠﺣﺎف ﻏﯾر اﻟﻣﻛﺗﻣل (The Unﬁnished Quilt) Description: A family's journey of healing and connection through their grandmother's ﬁnal project. ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗوﻓﯾت اﻟﺟدة ﺳﻌﺎد، ﺗرﻛت ﺧﻠﻔﮭﺎ ﻟﺣﺎﻓﺎً ﻏﯾر ﻣﻛﺗﻣل ﻓﻲ ﻏرﻓﺔ . اﻟﺧﯾﺎطﺔ ﻛﺎﻧت ﻗطﻊ اﻟﻘﻣﺎش اﻟﻣﻠوﻧﺔ ﻣرﺗﺑﺔ ﺑﻌﻧﺎﯾﺔ، وﻛل ﻗطﻌﺔ ﺗﺣﻣل ذﻛرى . ﺧﺎﺻﺔ ﻗررت اﻟﻌﺎﺋﻠﺔ - اﻷم ﻟﯾﻠﻰ وﺑﻧﺎﺗﮭﺎ : اﻟﺛﻼث ﻧور، ﺳﺎرة، وﻣرﯾم - إﻛﻣﺎل اﻟﻠﺣﺎف ﻣﻌﺎً ﻛوﺳﯾﻠﺔ ﻟﻠﺗﻌﺎﻣل ﻣﻊ ﺣزﻧﮭن . ﻣﻊ ﻛل ﻗطﻌﺔ ﻗﻣﺎش، ﻛﺎﻧت ﺗﻧﻛﺷف ﻗﺻﺔ . ﺟدﯾدة ﻗطﻌﺔ ﻣن ﻓﺳﺗﺎن زﻓﺎف ﻟﯾﻠﻰ، وأﺧرى ﻣن ﺛوب اﻟﻣدرﺳﺔ اﻷول ﻟﻧور، وﻗﻣﺎش ﻣن ﺳﺗﺎﺋر اﻟﻣﻧزل . اﻟﻘدﯾم ﻛل ﻣﺳﺎء، ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﻧﺳﺎء ﯾﺟﺗﻣﻌن ﺣول طﺎوﻟﺔ اﻟﺧﯾﺎطﺔ، ﯾﺗﺷﺎرﻛن اﻟﺿﺣﻛﺎت واﻟدﻣوع وھن ﯾروﯾن ﻗﺻﺻﺎً ﻟم ﯾﺳﻣﻌﻧﮭﺎ ﻣن ﻗﺑل . اﻛﺗﺷﻔت ﻣرﯾم، أﺻﻐر اﻷﺧوات، ﻣذﻛرات ﺻﻐﯾرة ﺧﺑﺄﺗﮭﺎ ﺟدﺗﮭﺎ ﻣﻊ ﺑﻌض ﻗطﻊ . اﻟﻘﻣﺎش ﻛﺎﻧت ﺗﺣﻛﻲ ﻋن أﺣﻼﻣﮭﺎ ﻟﺑﻧﺎﺗﮭﺎ وﺣﻔﯾداﺗﮭﺎ، وﻛﯾف ﻛﺎن اﻟﻠﺣﺎف وﺳﯾﻠﺗﮭﺎ ﻟﻧﺳﺞ ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺗﮭﺎ . ﻣﻌﺎً وﻓﻲ زاوﯾﺔ اﻟﻠﺣﺎف، وﺟدن رﺳﺎﻟﺔ : أﺧﯾرة ﻓﻲ " ﻛل ﻏرزة، ﺣب ﯾﺳﺗﻣر ". The Unﬁnished Quilt When Grandmother Suad passed away, she left behind an unﬁnished quilt in her sewing room. The colorful fabric pieces were carefully arranged, each piece holding a special memory. The family - mother Layla and her three daughters: Noor, Sarah, and Mariam - decided to complete the quilt together as a way to cope with their grief. With each piece of fabric, a new story unfolded. A piece from Layla's wedding dress, another from Noor's ﬁrst school uniform, and fabric from the old house's curtains. Every evening, the women gathered around the sewing table, sharing laughter and tears as they told stories they had never heard before.

Mariam, the youngest sister, discovered small notes her grandmother had hidden with some fabric pieces. They spoke of her dreams for her daughters and granddaughters, and how the quilt was her way of weaving her family together. And in the corner of the quilt, they found a ﬁnal message: "In every stitch, love continues." اﻟﻣﺳﺗوى اﻟﻣﺗﻘدم (Advanced Level) 1. ﻟﻘﺎء اﻷﻣطﺎر (The Rainy Reunion) Description: A chance encounter brings hidden emotions to the surface as two former lovers face their shared past and uncertain future. ﻓﻲ ﻣﺳﺎء ﻣﻣطر ﻣن أواﺧر اﻟﺧرﯾف، وﻗﻔت ﺳﻠﻣﻰ ﺗﺣت ﻣظﻠﺔ ﻣﺗﺟر ﻗدﯾم، ﺗﻧﺗظر ﺗوﻗف . اﻟﻣطر ﻛﺎﻧت ﻗد ﻋﺎدت ﻟﻠﺗو إﻟﻰ اﻟﻣدﯾﻧﺔ ﺑﻌد ﺧﻣس ﺳﻧوات ﻣن اﻟﻌﻣل ﻓﻲ . اﻟﺧﺎرج ﻓﺟﺄة، ﺳﻣﻌت ﺻوﺗﺎً ﻣﺄﻟوﻓﺎً - ﻛﺎن ﻣﺎﺟد، ﺣﺑﮭﺎ اﻷول وﺧطﯾﺑﮭﺎ اﻟﺳﺎﺑق . ﻛﺎن ھو أﯾﺿﺎً ﯾﺣﺗﻣﻲ ﻣن اﻟﻣطر، ﺑدا ﻋﻠﯾﮫ ﻧﻔس . اﻟﺗﻌﺟب ﺧﻣس ﺳﻧوات ﻣرت ﻣﻧذ اﻧﻔﺻﺎﻟﮭﻣﺎ اﻟﻣؤﻟم، ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ اﺧﺗﺎرت وظﯾﻔﺗﮭﺎ ﻋﻠﻰ . ﻋﻼﻗﺗﮭﻣﺎ ﻛﺎن اﻟﻣطر ﯾزداد ﻗوة، وﻗررا ﻣﺷﺎرﻛﺔ ﻓﻧﺟﺎن ﻗﮭوة ﻓﻲ اﻟﻣﻘﮭﻰ اﻟﻣﺟﺎور - ﻧﻔس اﻟﻣﻘﮭﻰ اﻟذي ﺷﮭد ﻟﻘﺎءاﺗﮭﻣﺎ اﻷوﻟﻰ . داﺧل اﻟﻣﻘﮭﻰ اﻟداﻓﺊ، ﺑدأت اﻟذﻛرﯾﺎت . ﺗﺗدﻓق ﺗذﻛرا ﺿﺣﻛﺎﺗﮭﻣﺎ، ﺧططﮭﻣﺎ ﻟﻠﻣﺳﺗﻘﺑل، واﻟﻠﺣظﺎت اﻟﺻﻐﯾرة اﻟﺗﻲ . ﺟﻣﻌﺗﮭﻣﺎ اﻋﺗرف ﻣﺎﺟد أﻧﮫ ﺗﺎﺑﻊ أﺧﺑﺎرھﺎ ﻋﺑر اﻷﺻدﻗﺎء اﻟﻣﺷﺗرﻛﯾن، وﻛﯾف ﻛﺎن ﯾﺷﻌر ﺑﺎﻟﻔﺧر ﺑﻧﺟﺎﺣﺎﺗﮭﺎ . اﻟﻣﮭﻧﯾﺔ أﺧﺑرﺗﮫ ﺳﻠﻣﻰ ﻛﯾف أن ﺻورﺗﮭﻣﺎ ﻣﻌﺎً ﻣﺎ زاﻟت ﻓﻲ ﻣﺣﻔظﺗﮭﺎ، وﻛﯾف ﻛﺎﻧت ﺗﺗﺳﺎءل داﺋﻣﺎً ﻋﻣﺎ ﻛﺎن ﯾﻣﻛن أن ﯾﺣدث ﻟو اﺗﺧذت ﻗراراً ﻣﺧﺗﻠﻔﺎً . ﻣﻊ اﺳﺗﻣرار اﻟﻣطر، اﻛﺗﺷﻔﺎ أن ﻣﺷﺎﻋرھﻣﺎ ﻟم ﺗﺗﻐﯾر ﺣﻘﺎً، ﻟﻛﻧﮭﻣﺎ ﺗﻐﯾرا . ﻛﺄﺷﺧﺎص ﻛﺎﻧﺎ أﻛﺛر ﻧﺿﺟﺎً اﻵن، أﻛﺛر ﻓﮭﻣﺎً ﻟﺗﻌﻘﯾدات اﻟﺣﯾﺎة . واﻟﺣب وﻋﻧدﻣﺎ ﺗوﻗف اﻟﻣطر أﺧﯾراً، ﺗﺑﺎدﻻ أرﻗﺎم ھواﺗﻔﮭﻣﺎ - ﻟﯾس ﻛﺣﺑﯾﺑﯾن ﺳﺎﺑﻘﯾن ﯾﺣﻧون ﻟﻠﻣﺎﺿﻲ، ﺑل ﻛﺷﺧﺻﯾن ﻣﺳﺗﻌدﯾن ﻻﻛﺗﺷﺎف ﻣﺎ ﻗد ﯾﺣﻣﻠﮫ اﻟﻣﺳﺗﻘﺑل . The Rainy Reunion On a rainy evening in late autumn, Salma stood under the awning of an old store, waiting for the rain to stop. She had just returned to the city after ﬁve years of working abroad. Suddenly, she heard a familiar voice - it was Majid, her ﬁrst love and former ﬁancé. He too was sheltering from the rain, looking equally surprised. Five years had passed since their painful separation, when she chose her career over their relationship. As the rain grew heavier, they decided to share a coﬀee in the nearby café - the same café that witnessed their ﬁrst meetings. Inside the warm café, memories began ﬂooding back. They remembered their laughter, their plans for the future, and the small moments that brought them together. Majid confessed he had followed her news through mutual friends, and how proud he felt of her professional successes. Salma told him how their photo was still in her wallet, and how she always wondered what might have been if she had made a diﬀerent choice. As the rain continued, they discovered their feelings hadn't really changed, but they had changed as people. They were more mature now, more understanding of life's

and love's complexities. And when the rain ﬁnally stopped, they exchanged phone numbers - not as former lovers longing for the past, but as two people ready to discover what the future might hold. 2. اﻟﺻورة اﻟﻣﻔﻘودة (The Missing Photograph) Description: A stolen photograph leads a renowned photographer on a journey through memory and reconciliation. ﻋﻧدﻣﺎ اﻗﺗﺣم ﻟﺻوص ﻣﻌرض ﯾوﺳف ﻟﻠﺗﺻوﯾر، ﻟم ﯾﺳرﻗوا ﺳوى ﺻورة واﺣدة - ﺻورة اﻟﺗﻘطﮭﺎ ﻗﺑل ﻋﺷرﯾن ﻋﺎﻣﺎً ﻷﻣﮫ ﻗﺑل وﻓﺎﺗﮭﺎ . ﺑﺄﯾﺎم ﻛﺎﻧت اﻟﺻورة اﻷﻛﺛر ﺷﮭرة ﻓﻲ ﻣﺟﻣوﻋﺗﮫ، ﺗظﮭر ﻓﯾﮭﺎ اﻣرأة ﻣﺳﻧﺔ ﺗﺟﻠس ﻓﻲ ﺣدﯾﻘﺔ ﻣﺷﻣﺳﺔ، ﺗﺑﺗﺳم اﺑﺗﺳﺎﻣﺔ ﻏﺎﻣﺿﺔ . ﻟﻠﻛﺎﻣﯾرا ﻟﻛن ﺑﺎﻟﻧﺳﺑﺔ ﻟﯾوﺳف، ﻛﺎﻧت أﻛﺛر ﻣن ﻣﺟرد ﻋﻣل ﻓﻧﻲ - ﻛﺎﻧت آﺧر ذﻛرى ﻟﮫ ﻣﻊ أﻣﮫ . ﺑدأ ﯾوﺳف رﺣﻠﺔ اﻟﺑﺣث ﻋن اﻟﺻورة، ﻣﺗﺗﺑﻌﺎً ﻛل ﺧﯾط . ﻣﻣﻛن ﻗﺎدﺗﮫ اﻟﺗﺣﻘﯾﻘﺎت إﻟﻰ ﻋﺎﻟم اﻟﻣﻘﺗﻧﯾﺎت اﻟﻔﻧﯾﺔ اﻟﺳرﯾﺔ، ﺣﯾث اﻛﺗﺷف أن ﺳﺎرق اﻟﺻورة ﻛﺎن ﺟﺎﻣﻌﺎً ﺛرﯾﺎً ﻣﮭووﺳﺎً . ﺑﺄﻋﻣﺎﻟﮫ ﻟﻛن ﻣﻊ ﺗﻌﻣﻘﮫ ﻓﻲ اﻟﺑﺣث، ﺑدأت ﺗظﮭر ﺣﻘﺎﺋق ﻏﯾر ﻣﺗوﻗﻌﺔ . ﻓﻲ ﻣﻛﺗب ﻣﺣﺎﻣﻲ اﻟﻌﺎﺋﻠﺔ اﻟﻘدﯾم، وﺟد وﺻﯾﺔ أﻣﮫ اﻟﺗﻲ ﻟم ﯾﻘرأھﺎ ﻣن . ﻗﺑل ﻛﺷﻔت اﻟوﺻﯾﺔ ﺳراً دﻓﯾﻧﺎً - اﻟﺣدﯾﻘﺔ ﻓﻲ اﻟﺻورة ﻛﺎﻧت ﻣﻠﻛﺎً ﻟﻌﺎﺋﻠﺔ أﺧرى، ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺔ اﻧﻔﺻل ﻋﻧﮭﺎ واﻟده ﻗﺑل . وﻻدﺗﮫ ﻛﺎﻧت أﻣﮫ ﺗﺣﺎول ﻓﻲ أﯾﺎﻣﮭﺎ اﻷﺧﯾرة إﺻﻼح ﺻدع ﻋﺎﺋﻠﻲ ﻗدﯾم . أﺧﯾراً، ﺗﺗﺑﻊ اﻟﺻورة إﻟﻰ ﻣﻧزل ﻗدﯾم ﻓﻲ طرف . اﻟﻣدﯾﻧﺔ ھﻧﺎك، اﻟﺗﻘﻰ ﺑﻌﻣﮫ اﻟﻣﺳن اﻟذي ﻟم ﯾﻌرف ﻋن وﺟوده ﻣن . ﻗﺑل ﻛﺎن ھو ﻣن أﺧذ اﻟﺻورة، ﻻ ﻟﯾﺳرﻗﮭﺎ، ﺑل ﻟﯾﻌﯾدھﺎ إﻟﻰ ﻣﻛﺎﻧﮭﺎ اﻷﺻﻠﻲ - اﻟﺣدﯾﻘﺔ اﻟﺗﻲ ﺟﻣﻌت اﻟﻌﺎﺋﻠﺔ . ﯾوﻣﺎً وﻣﻊ اﺳﺗﻌﺎدة اﻟﺻورة، اﺳﺗﻌﺎد ﯾوﺳف أﯾﺿﺎً ﺟزءاً ﻣﻔﻘوداً ﻣن ﺗﺎرﯾﺦ ﻋﺎﺋﻠﺗﮫ . The Missing Photograph When thieves broke into Yousef's photography gallery, they stole only one photograph - an image he had taken twenty years ago of his mother days before her death. It was his most famous piece, showing an elderly woman sitting in a sunny garden, smiling mysteriously at the camera. But for Yousef, it was more than just artwork - it was his last memory with his mother. Yousef began a journey to ﬁnd the photograph, following every possible lead. His investigation led him into the world of secret art collections, where he discovered the thief was a wealthy collector obsessed with his work. But as he delved deeper into the search, unexpected truths began to surface. In the old family lawyer's oﬃce, he found his mother's unread will. The will revealed a buried secret - the garden in the photograph belonged to another family, one his father had separated from before his birth. His mother had been trying, in her ﬁnal days, to heal an old family rift. Finally, he traced the photograph to an old house on the edge of the city. There, he met his elderly uncle whom he had never known existed. He was the one who had taken the photograph, not to steal it, but to return it to its original place - the garden that once brought the family together. And with the photograph's recovery, Yousef also recovered a lost piece of his family's history.
